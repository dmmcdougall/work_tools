# timesheetscrapper_python3

This overhaul has been done for several reasons.

1) To update the file so it complies to python 3.6 and later. 
2) To attempt to make the package more readable and compartmentalized
3) To help anonymize the personal data a bit more. 
4) To attempt to teach myself a little more python
5) To move into pandas and other libraries
